# **Rockets**

### **Overview**
A simple project that downloads Json about rockets that SpaceX make and displays it in a recyclerview.  
This is the first project I’ve written in Kotlin since spending the last couple of months learning the language, so I’m experimenting with things a bit here.  I’ve followed the recommended patterns from Google/Udacity and borrowed some of their image assets, so credit to them for that.
It has been interesting using databinding in the xml and shifting a lot of code away from the activity/fragments and into the view model, something which I haven’t tried before.  A fun part of this was customising the toolbar and playing around with transition animations.
I hope you like the project.
